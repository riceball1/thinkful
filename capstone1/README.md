#Multilingual Twitter

[Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com) Capstone `#1` project


##Use Case

Users are able to query twitter with a keyword and return results based on a limited number of tweets. The tweets will be displayed in a list, and a translate tool box will appear above the tweets list. Users can choose a language and it will translate the tweets into the selected language. Individual tweets can be tweeted out using a tweet button that opens a twitter modal that allows user to edit the text. Users also will be able to toggle between the original language and translated language of the individual tweets.
